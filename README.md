# Awesome FHE Research

![Research-FHE](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/Research-FHE/blob/master/Figure/Research-FHE.png)

This writing was inspired from [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), [awesome-mpc](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/awesome-mpc), and [awesome-cryptography](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/awesome-cryptography) and for our Cryptography research community.

This project designed to have a central place where everyone can find introductory and research materials, as well as open-source software designed for FHE. 

Please feel free to do a pull request with any FHE software or resource you know and it is not on the list. The current classification might not be most suitable one and I am open to any suggestions.

## THEORY


## FHE-TIMELINE

In fact, all these different HE attempts can neatly be categorized under three types of schemes with respect to the number of allowed operations on the encrypted data as follows:

 * Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)
 * Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE)
 * Fully Homo-morphic Encryption (FHE)

The following [Figure](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/Research-FHE/blob/master/Figure/HE-TIMELINE.png) shows the Timeline of Homomorphic Encryption(HE) schemes until Gentry’s first Fully-Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme.

Gentry’s first FHE scheme motivated a large amount of research in the area, mainly with the purpose of improving the efficiency of the original scheme. A Evolution of this research is presented in the following [Figure](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/Research-FHE/blob/master/Figure/FHE-EVOLUATION.png), with the most relevant references.

 * Ideal lattice based (Ideal)
 * Approximate Greatest Common Divisor (AGCD)
 * Learning With Errors (LWE)
 * Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU)
