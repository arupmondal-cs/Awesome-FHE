# Awesome FHE Research

![Research-FHE](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/Research-FHE/blob/master/Research-FHE.jpg)

This writing was inspired from [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), [awesome-mpc](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/awesome-mpc), and [awesome-cryptography](https://github.com/arupmondal-cs/awesome-cryptography) and for our Cryptography research community.

This project designed to have a central place where everyone can find introductory and research materials, as well as open-source software designed for FHE. 

Please feel free to do a pull request with any FHE software or resource you know and it is not on the list. The current classification might not be most suitable one and I am open to any suggestions.
